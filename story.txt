In a mango tree in a jungle, there lived many birds. The smallest of them all was an ecstatic sparrow named Jimbo.
It was Jimbo's first day in school and his first class was Nest Making 101.Jimbo is very excited because one of his
dreams is to be the best nest maker in the future. Instead of only taking this one, his plan is to finish the whole
sequence from 102 to 110.
